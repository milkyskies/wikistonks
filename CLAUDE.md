# Agent Instructions

All rules live in `.claude/rules/` and are loaded automatically. Read them.

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** to avoid hanging on prompts:

```bash
cp -f source dest
mv -f source dest
rm -f file
rm -rf directory
```

## Setup

After scaffolding, run these once to finish setup:

```bash
# Create GitHub repo
gh repo create wikistonks --source . --push

# Install glb (ghlobes) — task tracking via GitHub Issues + Projects
cargo install --git https://github.com/milkyskies/ghlobes.git
glb init                        # detects repo + project, writes .ghlobes.toml
```

See `.claude/rules/workflow.md` for daily glb usage.

## Key mise Commands

```bash
mise run dev                    # Full stack in tmux
mise run dev:api                # API server only
mise run dev:client             # Client app only
mise run check                  # Lint + test everything
mise run fmt                    # Format everything
mise run db:migrate             # Run database migrations
mise run db:reset               # Reset database
mise run api:generate           # Regenerate OpenAPI client
mise run worktree:setup <n> <branch>   # Create worktree for issue
mise run worktree:cleanup <n>          # Remove worktree
```

## Task Tracking with glb

This project uses `glb` (ghlobes) for issue tracking via GitHub Issues + Projects.
All state lives in GitHub — no local database.

### Workflow

1. **Find work:** Run `glb next` to get scored recommendations (or `glb ready` for the raw list).
2. **Claim work:** Run `glb update <number> --claim` to mark it as In Progress.
3. **Do the work:** Implement the issue.
4. **Finish:** Run `glb done <number> --comment "..."` — closes it and shows what newly unblocked + suggests next picks.

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `glb ready` | Show issues ready to work (unblocked, not in progress) |
| `glb list` | List all open issues. Filters: `--status`, `--priority`, `--assignee` |
| `glb show <num>` | Show issue details, deps, status, priority, points, sub-issues |
| `glb create --title "..." --priority P1 --status Backlog --points 3` | Create an issue |
| `glb update <num> --claim` | Claim issue (sets status to In Progress) |
| `glb update <num> --status <s> --priority <p> --points <n>` | Update fields |
| `glb close <num>` | Close an issue |
| `glb done <num>` | Close + show what newly unblocked + suggest next picks |
| `glb reopen <num>` | Reopen a closed issue |
| `glb dep add <issue> <blocked_by>` | Add a blocking dependency |
| `glb dep list <issue>` | Show dependencies |
| `glb sub add <parent> <child>` | Add a sub-issue to a parent (epic) |
| `glb sub remove <parent> <child>` | Remove a sub-issue from a parent |
| `glb sub list <parent>` | List sub-issues with progress |
| `glb blocked` | Show all blocked issues |
| `glb stuck` | Top blockers + per-epic stuck counts (bottleneck dashboard) |
| `glb tree <num>` | Recursive sub-issue tree with status icons + blockers |
| `glb deps <num>` | Bidirectional transitive dep tree. `--upstream`, `--downstream` |
| `glb closed --since 7d` | List recently closed issues. `--in-epic <num>`, `--limit N` |
| `glb path` | Critical path + high-leverage issues. `--by-count`, `--top N`, `--epic <num>`, `--explain` |
| `glb next` | Recommend next batch. `--agents N` (3), `--epic <num>`, `--track <name>`, `--diverse`, `--reason`, `--exclude <num>` |
| `glb search "query"` | Search issues by text |
| `glb stats` | Show open/closed/blocked/ready counts |
| `glb init --update-claude-md` | Refresh these agent instructions |

### Statuses

- **Backlog** — acknowledged, not yet prioritized for active work
- **Todo** — ready to be picked up
- **In Progress** — someone is actively working on it
- **Done** — completed

`glb ready` shows only **Todo** issues that are unblocked and unassigned.

### Points

Use **Fibonacci numbers** for the `--points` field: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13`.
This represents effort/complexity. When estimating, pick the closest Fibonacci value.
- `1` — trivial (< 1 hour)
- `2` — small (a few hours)
- `3` — medium (half a day)
- `5` — large (full day)
- `8` — very large (2–3 days)
- `13` — epic (break it down into sub-issues instead if possible)

### Epics (sub-issues)

Use `glb sub` to organize work into parent/child hierarchies (epics).
GitHub renders these natively with a progress bar on the parent issue.

```
# Create an epic and its tasks
glb create --title "Auth system"          # e.g. becomes #10
glb create --title "Design auth flow"     # e.g. becomes #11
glb create --title "Implement auth"       # e.g. becomes #12

# Link them
glb sub add 10 11
glb sub add 10 12

# Optional: make tasks sequential with a blocking dep
glb dep add 12 11   # #12 blocked by #11
```

### Rules

- **Always run `glb next` at the start of a session** to get scored recommendations.
- **Always `--claim` before starting work** so other agents don't pick the same issue.
- **Never work on issues with status `In Progress`** — another agent is on it.
- **Create issues for new work** instead of just doing it. This keeps the project organized.
- **Add dependencies** when an issue can't be done until another is finished.
- **Use `glb done <num>`** when finishing — it shows what newly unblocked.
- **No em or en dashes in titles.** Use a hyphen `-` or colon `:`. `glb create` enforces this.
